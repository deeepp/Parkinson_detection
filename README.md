# Parkinson_detection
This is a project that detects whether a person has Parkinson's disease or not. 
According to wikipedia, Parkinson's disease  is a long-term degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that mainly affects the motor system.
The symptoms usually emerge slowly, and as the disease worsens, non-motor symptoms become more common.The most obvious early symptoms are tremor, rigidity, slowness of movement, and difficulty with walking.[1] 
Cognitive and behavioral problems may also occur with depression, anxiety, and apathy. 
PD is diagonised by supervised model, using  SVM algorithm[Support vector Model] that creates the best line or decision boundary
that can segregate n-dimensional space into classes s. This best decision boundary is called a hyperplane.
